Streams are wrappers around a data source, allowing us to operate with that data source and 
making bulk processing convenient and fast.

A stream does not store data and, in that sense, is not a data structure. It also never 
modifies the underlying data source.

A Stream in Java 8 can be defined as a sequence of elements from a source. Streams supports 
aggregate operations on the elements. The source of elements here refers to a Collection or 
Array that provides data to the Stream.

Stream keeps the ordering of the elements the same as the ordering in the source. The 
aggregate operations are operations that allow us to express common manipulations on stream 
elements quickly and clearly.

Java 8 Streams are designed in such a way that most of the stream operations return a stream. 
This helps us to create a chain of stream operations. This is called as pipe-lining.
