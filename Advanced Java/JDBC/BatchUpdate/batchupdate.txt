A batch update is a batch of updates grouped together, and sent to the database in one 
"batch", rather than sending the updates one by one.

Sending a batch of updates to the database in one go, is faster than sending them one by one, 
waiting for each one to finish. There is less network traffic involved in sending one batch 
of updates (only 1 round trip), and the database might be able to execute some of the updates 
in parallel. The speed up compared to executing the updates one by one, can be quite big.

You can batch both SQL inserts, updates and deletes. It does not make sense to batch select 
statements.

There are three ways to execute batch updates:

    Using a Statement  
    Using a PreparedStatement  
    Using a CallableStatement
