MongoDB's use DATABASE_NAME command is used to create database.

The command will create a new database, if it doesn't exist. Otherwise it will return the 
existing database.


Syntax

Basic syntax of use DATABASE statement is as follows:

use DATABASE_NAME

Example

To create a database with name mydb, then use DATABASE statement would be as follows:

>use mydb
switched to db mydb

To check your currently selected database use the command db

>db
mydb

To check your databases list, then use the command show dbs.

>show dbs
local     0.72222GB
test      0.22222GB

Empty database (mydb) is not present in list. To display database, insert some data into it.

>db.movie.insert({"name":"dhoni","producer":"dhoni1","vilen":"salman"})
>show dbs
local     0.72225GB
mydb      0.22222GB
test      0.23012GB

In mongodb default database is test. If you didn't create any database then collections will 
be stored in test database.
