Stored Procedures are group of statements that we compile in the database for some task. 
Stored procedures are beneficial when we are dealing with multiple tables with complex 
scenario and rather than sending multiple queries to the database, we can send required data 
to the stored procedure and have the logic executed in the database server itself.

JDBC API provides support to execute Stored Procedures through CallableStatement interface. 
Stored Procedures requires to be written in the database specific syntax

A java.sql.CallableStatement is used to call stored procedures in a database.

A stored procedure is like a function or method in a class, except it lives inside the 
database. Some database heavy operations may benefit performance-wise from being executed 
inside the same memory space as the database server, as a stored procedure.
