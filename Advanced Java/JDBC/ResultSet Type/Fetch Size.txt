Fetch Size

By default, when Oracle JDBC executes a query, it receives the result set 10 rows at a time 
from the database cursor. This is the default Oracle row-prefetch value. You can change the 
number of rows retrieved with each trip to the database cursor by changing the row-prefetch 
value.

JDBC 2.0 also allows you to specify the number of rows fetched with each database round trip 
for a query, and this number is referred to as the fetch size. In Oracle JDBC, the 
row-prefetch value is used as the default fetch size in a statement object. Setting the fetch 
size overrides the row-prefetch setting and affects subsequent queries executed through that 
statement object.

Fetch size is also used in a result set. When the statement object executes a query, the 
fetch size of the statement object is passed to the result set object produced by the query. 
However, you can also set the fetch size in the result set object to override the statement 
fetch size that was passed to it. (Also note that changes made to a statement object's fetch 
size after a result set is produced will have no affect on that result set.)



Setting the Fetch Size

The following methods are available in all Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement, 
and ResultSet objects for setting and getting the fetch size:

    void setFetchSize(int rows) throws SQLException
    int getFetchSize() throws SQLException
