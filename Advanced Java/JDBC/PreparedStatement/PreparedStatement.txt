The main feature of a PreparedStatement object is that, unlike a Statement object, it is 
given a SQL statement when it is created. The advantage to this is that in most cases, this 
SQL statement is sent to the DBMS right away, where it is compiled. As a result, the 
PreparedStatement object contains not just a SQL statement, but a SQL statement that has been 
precompiled. This means that when the PreparedStatement is executed, the DBMS can just run 
the PreparedStatement SQL statement without having to compile it first.

A PreparedStatement is a special kind of Statement object with some useful features. 
Remember, you need a Statement in order to execute either a query or an update. You can use 
a PreparedStatement instead of a Statement and benefit from the features of the 
PreparedStatement.

The PreparedStatement's primary features are:

    Easy to insert parameters into the SQL statement.
    Easy to reuse the PreparedStatement with new parameters.
    May increase performance of executed statements.
    Enables easier batch updates
