The first four bytes of every Java class file are its magic number, 0xCAFEBABE. The  
magic number makes non-Java class files easier to identify. If a file does not start with  
0xCAFEBABE, it definitely is not a Java class file.  
--------------------------------------------------------  
The second four bytes of the class file contain the minor and major version numbers.  
As Java technology evolves, new features may occasionally be added to the Java  
class file format. Each time the class file format changes, the version numbers will  
change as well. To the Java Virtual Machine, the version numbers identify the format  
to which a particular class file adheres. Java Virtual Machines will generally be able to  
load class files with a given major version number and a range of minor version  
numbers. Java Virtual Machines must reject class files with version numbers outside  
their valid range.  
For class files generated by 1.0 or 1.1 compilers, the major version number is 45. The  
minor version number is 3.
