javax.servlet.AsyncContext is an interface introduced in Servlet 3.0. AsyncContext has the 
role to start asynchronous context within a servlet using HttpServletRequest.startAsync() 
method. We can divide our task for asynchronous execution. Within a servlet, some of the task 
can be performed by another servlet or jsp and some of the task can be done by parent servlet 
itself and finally response will be sent collectively. AsyncContext is started by Request 
object as below

AsyncContext asyncContext = request.startAsync();

We can also set the timeout for asynchronous context. For the example we scan set indefinite 
timeout by setting it as 0.

To divide the task of parent servlet I am calling a jsp which will execute other task. For 
this AsyncContext provides dispatch() method. We can use it as below

asyncContext.dispatch("/asynctest.jsp");
