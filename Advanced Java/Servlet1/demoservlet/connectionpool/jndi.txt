Using the Java Naming and Directory Interface->

A naming service maintains a set of bindings, which relate names to objects. The J2EE™ naming 
service is based on the Java Naming and Directory Interface™ (JNDI) API. The JNDI API allows 
application components and clients to look up distributed resources, services, and EJB™ 
components

Sun Java System Application Server provides a naming environment, or context, which is 
compliant with standard J2EE 1.4 requirements. A Context object provides the methods for 
binding names to objects, unbinding names from objects, renaming objects, and listing the 
bindings. The InitialContext is the handle to the J2EE naming service that application 
components and clients use for lookups.
