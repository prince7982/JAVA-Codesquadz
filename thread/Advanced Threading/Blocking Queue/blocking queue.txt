A blocking queue is a queue that blocks when you try to dequeue from it and the queue is
empty, or if you try to enqueue items to it and the queue is already full. A thread trying to
dequeue from an empty queue is blocked until some other thread inserts an item into the
queue. A thread trying to enqueue an item in a full queue is blocked until some other thread
makes space in the queue, either by dequeuing one or more items or clearing the queue
completely.

A BlockingQueue with one thread putting into it, and another thread taking from it.
Java 5 comes with blocking queue implementations in the java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue
package.
