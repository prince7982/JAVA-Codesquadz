/* ReentrantLock Example->
Hr of a company wants to hire 3 java developer. For this he select 3 Tech Leads to conduct 
test and select candidates. One Tech Lead will select one candidate. But their is only one 
question paper, and xerox machine is not working. So now at a time only one Tech Lead can 
conduct the test. When one Tech Lead is having question paper it conducts the test and other 
Tech Leads have to wait for question paper. When one Tech Lead has taken the test then he 
gives question paper back. Now other Tech Leads can take the question paper and conduct 
Test. */
