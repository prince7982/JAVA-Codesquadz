/* CountDownLatch

This is a more advanced type of synchronization that can be done with concurrent package.
Consider the example where a Organization needs to recruit 3 Java Developers. For this HR 
Manager has asked 3 Tech Leads to take interview.
The HR Manager wants to distribute the Offer letter only after all the 3 Java Developers 
have been recruited. In Threading terminology the HR Manger should wait till 3 Java 
Developers have been recruited. */
