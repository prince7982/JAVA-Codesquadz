/*Exchanger is a synchronization point at which threads can pair and swap elements within
pairs. Each thread presents some object on entry to the exchange method, matches with a
partner thread, and receives its partner's object on return. An Exchanger may be viewed as a
bidirectional form of a SynchronousQueue.

This java program creates 2 threads passing them an exchanger and a message. Each thread
prints out its own message, then exchanges it with the other thread, then prints out its new
exchanged message.*/
