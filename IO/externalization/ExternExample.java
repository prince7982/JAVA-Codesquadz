1.. In this example, class Car implements Externalizable interface which means that car object is ready for 
serialization. This class has two public methods - "writeExternal" and "readExternal". Unlike Serializable interface 
which will serialize all the variables in the object with just by implementing the interface, here you have to 
explicitly mention what fields or variables you want to serialize and the same is done in "writeExternal" and 
"readExternal" methods. So in the "ExternExample" class, when you write the "Car" object to the OutputStream, 
the "writeExternal" method is called and the data is persisted. The same applies to "readExternal" method in the 
Car object i.e., when you read the "Car" object from the ObjectInputStream, "readExternal" method is called.

2. Also the information about class description is added to the stream which includes the description of all the 
serializable superclasses. the description of the class and the instance data associated with the specific instance
of the class. Lots of data and metadata and again performance issue.

3. Now when an Externalizable object is reconstructed, an instance is created first using the public no-arg 
constructor, then the readExternal method is called.

4. When an object that implements Serializable interface, is serialized or de-serialized, no constructor of the 
object is called and hence any initialization which is done in the constructor cannot be done.

5. Externalization is nothing but serialization but by implementing Externalizable interface to persist and restore 
the object. To externalize your object, you need to implement Externalizable interface that extends Serializable 
interface. Here only the identity of the class is written in the serialization stream and it is the responsibility of the 
class to save and restore the contents of its instances which means you will have complete control of what to 
serialize and what not to serialize. But with serialization the identity of all the classes, its superclasses, instance 
variables and then the contents for these items is written to the serialization stream. But to externalize an object, 
you need a default public constructor.

6. Limitations of Serialization

1) File size is very high  
2) Customization due to transient which is not effective because we get null in place of transient attributes.

7. One thing you can do with Externalization is that, you can store extra information into Objects like STATIC 
variables and transient variables or you can add more information. If you have any business need  

8. Externalization allows you to customize how serialization is done. By implementing externalization you are  
   controlling what gets serialized ( and what doesn't ) as versus default serialization where all non-transient
   attributes get serialized.
